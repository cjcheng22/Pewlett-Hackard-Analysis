# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Wk7
# 1. Overview of the analysis: 
## The purpose if this analysis is for Pewlett-Hackard to prepare for the upcoming "Sliver Tsunami", a wave of employees approaching their retirement age, by analyzing into employee tables on how many employees are born in certain years and what their titles are, and how many/who among them are elible by their age for a mentorship program.  
### - Determine the number of retiring employees per title
### - Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
# 2. Results: There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.

![Mentorship_Eligibility](/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.png)

## ・61,318 does not have "to_date" of "1/1/9999", meaning 61,318 employees are eligile for active members who are eligible for retiring
## ・Among 61,318 who are eligible for retiring, only 1,549 are eligible for the Mentor program.
## ・Among 61,318, only 4 are currently managers; all other retirement eligible members are engineers/staffs/technical leaders.
## ・Duplicate titles are in retiring titles csv file.  The analysis with removed duplictes will present better datapoint.
# 3. Summary: The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight.
